# psychopy_biosemi_serial
A set of Psychopy demos showing how to send triggers via the biosemi serial adapter, or a Cedrus Stimtracker box.
 
Created in Psychopy v2022.2.4. 

This demo shows you how to send triggers in conjunction with a text
stimulus. Demos are created using the PsychoPy Builder, but with a few
code components. Note that attempting to do this with a Serial Port
Component in Builder doesn't seem to work very well. Text and trigger
values are set in the provided Excel sheet. 

Thanks to Dr. Blake Butler, U. Western Ontario, for adapting the serial
port code for use pyxid2 and a Cedrus Stimtracker.

This code is provided for educational purposes only and I make no
representations on whether it provides adequate timing or works
correctly. I can't guarantee I can help with technical issues. But if
